# GreenLabel
Green Label is a responsive web application that enables businesses to run image labeling competitions to solve machine learning classification problems.

###About
I have developed this application as part of my CS-411 Database systems course from the University of Illinois.

###Tech Stack
The application consists of two main parts stored in the same monorepository. The [backend](api/readme.md) is a REST API written in PHP and backed by a MySQL database.

The front end is a simple multi page HTML + JavaScript application supported by jQuery and styled with Bootstrap.
